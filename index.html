	aims to provide an easy way to train an AI agent.
</p>

<p>
    The project consists of three components: the client, the server and the index.
    The role of the index is to provide a list of servers at a known address, so
    it's a simple program that servers contact when they become alive and when
    they are terminating to request the index to add/remove themselves, and the 
    client contacts the index to get a list of available servers that the user
    may use to choose a server to connect to.
</p>

<p>
    Both the client and the server are programs used as a publishing method
    for plug-ins. The server runs a virtual world and it may or may not
    be connected with a rendering device. Its main purpose is to keep and
    update a "scene graph" and to send streams of information to clients.
    Plug-ins are registered with the server to provide avatar types
    that handle both the way the avatar is being rendered (textures, meshes, etc)
    and the way it behaves (capabilities).
</p>

<p>
    After choosing a server (that is, a virtual world), a client queries the
    server about the types of avatars it has and allows the user to choose
    an avatar. This avatar then needs to be associated with an actor - the brain
    of the avatar provided as a plug-in for the client. The actor may the
    start to learn to use the avatar or it may load previously stored knowledge
    and go interact with other actors incarnated in avatars.
</p>

<p>
    The way this system is envisioned is as follows: the user runs both a 
    server and a client on a local machine and lets the actor learn to deal with
    the avatar body (maybe in a simplified world) and, once that is done,
    the actor is connected with an avatar in a remote virtual world,
    where it may continue the training in the complex environment that
    results from other actors interacting with the virtual world.
</p>

<p>
    The client side software that controls the avatar is called an <i>actor</i>
    and not a <i>brain</i> because it may contain additional components
    like DNA for evolutionary learning.
