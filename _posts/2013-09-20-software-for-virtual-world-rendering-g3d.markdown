This page is part of the series that explores existing
[software for virtual world rendering][root].

The G3D Innovation Engine is a commercial-grade C++ 3D 
engine available as Open Source (BSD License). 
It is used in commercial games, research papers, 
military simulators, and university courses. G3D 
supports hardware accelerated real-time rendering, 
off-line rendering like ray tracing, and general 
purpose computation on GPUs.

G3D provides a set of routines and structures so 
common that they are needed in almost every 
graphics program. It makes low-level libraries like 
OpenGL and sockets easier to use without limiting 
functionality or performance. G3D is a rock-solid, 
highly optimized base on which to build your 
3D application.
