This page is part of the series that explores existing
[software for virtual world rendering][root].

[Unity3D][u3d] is a game development ecosystem: 
a powerful rendering engine fully integrated 
with a complete set of intuitive tools and rapid workflows 
to create interactive 3D content; easy multi-platform 
publishing; thousands of quality, ready-made assets 
in the Asset Store and a knowledge-sharing Community 
(from their site).

According to [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_%28game_engine%29)
there are two main licenses for developers: 
Unity Free and Unity Pro.
Unity Pro is available for US$1500. 
Unity Free is free as long as the user is not a 
commercial organization with annual gross revenues 
in excess of US$100,000, or an educational, academic, 
non-profit or government entity with a total 
annual budget for the entire entity in excess of 
US$100,000.

This was the first engine that I've looked into because
[OpenCog][ocg] team has already used it in a similar
[project](https://github.com/opencog/unity3d-opencog-game).

However, I'm expecting a steep learning curve as the engine 
looks quite complex. The source code being close-source is
another minus.
