This page is part of the series that explores existing
[software for virtual world rendering][root].

[PlaneShift][pshift] is a Role Playing Game immersed into a 
3D virtual fantasy world which is FULLY FREE to play. 
PlaneShift is made by a group of RPG enthusiasts and 
not by a commercial company. PlaneShift is Open Source for 
the client and server code, so everyone can contribute 
to its development!

The project is hosted at [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/planeshift/)
and a [PlaneShift Compiling Guide](https://svn.code.sf.net/p/planeshift/code/trunk/docs/compiling.html) is available.

Based on initial evaluation ([1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GhBcCpEGt0),
[2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGVYk3DoP0g), 
[3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i79VouVkrAg))
this looks like a good balance between the complexity of the
world (that we want to be high) and the resources used
(that we want to be low).
