    <p>
    Although the definition and measurement of 
    intelligence is clearly of fundamental 
    importance to the field of artificial 
    intelligence, no general survey of 
    definitions and tests of machine 
    intelligence exists. Indeed few researchers 
    are even aware of alternatives to the Turing 
    test and its many derivatives. In this paper 
    we fill this gap by providing a short survey 
    of the many tests of machine intelligence 
    that have been proposed.
