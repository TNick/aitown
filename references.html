	<h4>Shane Legg, Marcus Hutter</h4>
    <p>
		Although the definition and measurement of 
		intelligence is clearly of fundamental 
		importance to the field of artificial 
		intelligence, no general survey of 
		definitions and tests of machine 
		intelligence exists. Indeed few researchers 
		are even aware of alternatives to the Turing 
		test and its many derivatives. In this paper 
		we fill this gap by providing a short survey 
		of the many tests of machine intelligence 
		that have been proposed.

    </h3>
    <p>
		ØMQ (also seen as ZeroMQ, 0MQ, zmq) looks like an embeddable 
		networking library but acts like a concurrency framework. It gives 
		you sockets that carry atomic messages across various transports 
		like in-process, inter-process, TCP, and multicast. You can connect 
		sockets N-to-N with patterns like fanout, pub-sub, task 
		distribution, and request-reply. It's fast enough to be the fabric 
		for clustered products. Its asynchronous I/O model gives you 
		scalable multicore applications, built as asynchronous 
		message-processing tasks. It has a score of language APIs and runs 
		on most operating systems. ØMQ is from iMatix and is LGPLv3 open 
		source. (<a href="http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all">ØMQ - The Guide</a>)

    <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org">OGRE</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
		OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a 
		scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to 
		make it easier and more intuitive for developers to produce 
		applications utilising hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. The 
		class library abstracts all the details of using the underlying 
		system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and provides an 
		interface based on world objects and other intuitive classes.

    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/inih/">inih</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
		inih (INI Not Invented Here) is a simple .INI file parser 
		written in C. It's only a couple of pages of code, and it was 
		designed to be small and simple, so it's good for embedded 
		systems.

    <a href="https://github.com/Malvineous/cfgpath">cfgpath</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
		This is a simple header file that provides a handful of 
		functions to obtain paths to configuration files, regardless of 
		the operating system the application is running under.
		It requires no dependencies beyond each platform's standard API.

    <a href="http://sglib.sourceforge.net/">SGLIB</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
		Sglib is a library defining useful macros for manipulating 
		common data structures. The library currently provides 
		generic implementation for:
		sorting arrays, 
		manipulating linked lists, 
		manipulating sorted linked lists, 
		manipulating double linked lists, 
		manipulating red-black trees, 
		manipulating hashed containers.

	<h3 id="argtable">
    <a href="http://argtable.sourceforge.net/">argtable</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
		Argtable is an ANSI C library for parsing GNU style command 
		line options with a minimum of fuss. It enables a program's 
		command line syntax to be defined in the source code as an 
		array of argtable structs.
